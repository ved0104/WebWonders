   content:["With COP26 underway in Glasgow, it's useful to understand the science behind climate change.","Here, an atmospheric scientist explores the key driving forces behind climate change and the impact it's having on the planet.","While larger-scale solutions such as renewable energy are being used to combat rising temperatures, more people are now finding ways to reduce their own personal impact."]

    content:["Once in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide tends to stay there for a very long time. A portion of the carbon dioxide released through human activities is taken up by plants, and some is absorbed directly into the ocean, but roughly half of all carbon dioxide emitted by human activities today stays in the atmosphere â€” and it likely will remain there for hundreds of years, influencing the climate globally.","During the first year of the pandemic in 2020, when fewer people were driving and some industries briefly stopped, carbon dioxide emissions from fuels fell by roughly 6%. But it didn't stop the rise in the concentration of carbon dioxide because the amount released into the atmosphere by human activities far exceeded what nature could absorb.","If civilization stopped its carbon dioxide-emitting activities today, it would still take many hundreds of years for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to fall enough naturally to bring the planet's carbon cycle back into balance because of carbon dioxide's long life in the atmosphere."]

    content:["if people completely stopped burning fossil fuels in 2021, models estimate the atmospheric CO2 concentration would decline slowly, taking over a century to return to even 1980s levels. Waiting 20 years to stop all emissions would take much longer, as the dashed line shows."]

    content:["Laboratory measurements since the 1800s have repeatedly verified and quantified the absorptive properties of carbon dioxide that allow it to trap heat in the atmosphere.","Simple models based on the warming impact of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere match historical changes in temperature.","Complex climate models, recently acknowledged in the Nobel Prize for Physics, not only indicate a warming of the Earth due to increases in carbon dioxide but also offer details of the areas of greatest warming.","Long-term records from ice cores, tree rings and corals show that when carbon dioxide levels have been high, temperatures have also been high."]
